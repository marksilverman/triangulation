1) nothing to fill on the 1st row, so freeze the top-most triangle
2) one triangle to fill on row 2
   we don't know which one but it must point up (so it can continue down)
   that means you can freeze the down-triangle (r2c2)
4) that leaves two possible triangles
   one of them starts a pyramid which must continue down
   whichever one it is, it will include r3c3, so fill it in
5) row #4 has five triangles to fill
   they must connect to the pyramid from rows #2 and #3
   we don't know exactly where they go
   but r4c3 to r4c5 must be part of it, so fill them in
6) same logic for r5c3 to r5c7 and r6c3 to r6c10
7) row #7 has only one triangle to fill
   so it can't be connected to the pyramid we've been working on
   and it must continue down
   the only candidates are c1 and c13, so freeze r7c2 to r7c12
8) row #8 has five triangles to shade
   three will connect to the top on row #7
   two must be new pyramids so they will point up
   but we don't know where they go yet
   so 'r'otate the board
9) the first three rows can be filled and the 4th can be frozen
10) fill the two-row triangle on the bottom-right corner
    then freeze the column on its left
11) look at the bottom row (#15)
    it's divided into two sections by c12
	it needs 12 shaded triangles
	you can't fit all 12 onto the right side
	so at least one must go on the left side
	but you can't add just one to the left side
	it has to continue the entire pyramid
	so fill in all nine
	then freeze the outline around that pyramid
12) 'r'otate twice
13) the triangle on row #7 can only go in one place
    add it and add three triangles under it
14) freeze r8c12, r8c11, and r9c12
15) row #9 is split into two sides
    but 11 triangles can't go on the left side
	so you must fill five triangles on the right side
16) the pyramid can't continue downward
    (it would need 7 but only 5 are available)
    so freeze all around it
17) rotate twice
18) freeze r4c1 and r4c7, fill r4c4, freeze r5c5
19) freeze r13c4 to r13c10
20) freeze r15c9, fill r14c8
21) rotate twice
22) row #5 is split in two
    three must go on the left side (and you can freeze that pyramid)
	one up-triangle goes on the right
	so freeze r5c8, fill r6c9, fill r7c9 to r7c11
23) freeze the rest of row #8
24) rotate
25) row #12, five triangles must go in r12c3 to r12c7
    then freeze the left side of that pyramid
	and freeze rows 12 and 13
26) fill 7 triangles on row 11 (freeze r11c8 and r11c16)
27) fill that pyramid upwards (it's 4 rows high) and freeze around it
28) rotate and freeze row #10
29) fill in little pyramid on row #8 and #9, freeze it
30) rotate twice
31) add a pyramid pointing downward with the bottom at r10c6
32) freeze row #8
33) fill r7c1 to r7c5, continue pyramid up two rows, freeze right side
34) rotate and freeze row #13
35) fill in the down-pyramid on r14c4
36) rotate twice
37) fill in final pyramid which starts at r5c7
